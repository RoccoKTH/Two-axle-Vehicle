# Two-axle Railway Vehicle

The work summarized below is part of the Ph.D. thesis by Rocco Libero Giossi with title **Mechatronic aspects of an innovative two-axle railway vehicle**, [DiVA](http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/person.jsf?pid=authority-person%3A76366&dswid=-2600)

The vehicle has been developed under the projects Run2Rail, Pivot, NEXTGEAR, and Pivot2 within the Shift2Rail research program where the goals for a sustainable growth of the railway sector are set.

The innovative two-axle vehicle that can reduce weight, initial investment and maintenance cost, and emissions is proposed for a metro line system. The vehicle proposed will have only one suspension step. To further reduce the weight and incorporate the otherwise missing anti-roll bar, a composite material connection frame is introduced. The two-axle configuration suffers from poor ride comfort, due to the lack of a second suspension step acting as filter, and from poor steering capability, due to the long distance between wheelsets. Active suspensions are therefore introduced to improve both ride comfort and steering capability.

## Vehicle vibrations control
The vehicle vibrations are reduced by the active system.
