# Two-axle Railway Vehicle

The work summarized below is part of the Ph.D. thesis by Rocco Libero Giossi with title **Mechatronic aspects of an innovative two-axle railway vehicle**, [DiVA](http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/person.jsf?pid=authority-person%3A76366&dswid=-2600)

A railway vehicle has been developed under the projects Run2Rail, Pivot, NEXTGEAR, and Pivot2 within the Shift2Rail research program where the goals for a sustainable growth of the railway sector are set.

An innovative two-axle vehicle that can reduce weight, initial investment and maintenance cost, and emissions is proposed for a metro line system. The vehicle proposed will have only one suspension step. To further reduce the weight and incorporate the otherwise missing anti-roll bar, a composite material connection frame is introduced. The two-axle configuration suffers from poor ride comfort, due to the lack of a second suspension step acting as filter, and from poor steering capability, due to the long distance between wheelsets. Active suspensions are therefore introduced to improve both ride comfort and steering capability.

## Vehicle ride comfort control

The poor ride comfort of the vehicle with standard dampers can be imrpoved when using active hydraulic cylinders. In the example video, one vehicle with **Passive** dampers and one with **Active** cylinders run on the same 1000 m railway track at 80 km/h. The carbody accelerations are greately reduced when using the active configuration, reducing the oscillations reaching the passenger and improving the passenger ride comfort.

The passenger in the video serves only the purpose of highlighting the benefits of the active configuration. The passender model is originated using as a reference the work by [A.A. Nikooyan et al.](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0954411911424210#bibr44-0954411911424210).

## Vehicle steering control

The poor wheelset steering capability of the two-axle vehicle with passive longitudinal suspensions can be improved with active steering. In the example video, one vehicle equiped with **Passive** longitudinal suspensions and one with **Active** longitudinal actuators run over a cirvular curve of 400 m radius with an initial speed of 80 km/h. The active suspensions improve the steering capability of the vehicle reducing the dissipated energy between the wheel and the rail. As a result, a lower vehicle speed reduction is seen and therefore a longer travelled distance within the same time. In the video, a pillar is shown every 100 m.

To give a fair comparison between the two vehicle in terms of energy consuption, the energy used by the actuators is calculated starting from the require actuation power where a global efficiency factor of 0.5 is considerd.
